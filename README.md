This code example requires 3 analog inputs connected to the ADC. Connect a differential input to Input1 and Input2. Input3 and Input 4 are singled ended inputs.

Pin assignments for ADC inputs for supported kits are as follows:

**Table 1. ADC input signals**

| Development kit | Input1 | Input2 | Input3 | Input4 |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| CY8CKIT-149      | 2[0] | 2[1] | 1[6] | 6[0] |
| CY8CKIT-041-41XX | 2[0] | 2[1] | 1[5] | 0[0] |
| CY8CKIT-045S     | 2[2] | 2[3] | 1[5] | 6[1] |
| CY8CKIT-041S-MAX | 2[0] | 2[1] | 1[6] | 6[0] |


**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 4 kits ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [firmware loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).



## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New application** link in the **quick panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; application**). This launches the [project creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project creator - Choose board support package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [library manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the library manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the library manager, click the link from the **quick panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project creator - Select application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New application name**.

5. The **Application(s) root path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) root path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the project creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone a "SAR ADC" application with the desired name "MySARADC" configured for the *CY8CKIT-041S-MAX* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-sar-adc --user-app-name MySARADC --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone pProject creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch the project creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose board support package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application name> debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **quick panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

### ADC configuration

This example shows how an ADC can be configured using the device configurator and how different types of inputs are connected to ADC channels.

**Figure 2. Inputs connected to the ADC**

![](images/sar_adc_connection.jpg)

The ADC uses an internal band-gap reference in bypass mode as the voltage reference. Four channels are converted in each conversion cycle. A 12MHz clock is used as the clock source.

**Figure 2. Basic ADC configuration**

![](images/adc_config_1.jpg)

ADC channel 0 is configured in differential mode. Input1 and Input2 act as the differential terminals for channel0. These inputs are routed through the SAR Mux resource of the device.

**Figure 3. ADC Channel 0 configuration**

![](images/adc_channel0.jpg)


ADC channel 1 is configured in single-ended mode. Input3 to channel1 is buffered through CTMB0 configured in follower mode.

**Figure 4. CTBM0 configuration**

![](images/ctbm_config.jpg)


ADC channel 2 is configured in single-ended mode. Input4 to this channel is routed through the AMUXBUS resource of the device.

**Figure 5. ADC Channel 2 configuration**

![](images/adc_channel2.jpg)


Finally, ADC channel 3 is configured in single-ended mode. This channel converts the Die Temperature block input. The ADC PDL provides the API to convert the count value to degree celsius.

For accurate temperature conversion, averaging (256 samples) is enabled; the acquisition time is 5 us for this channel.

**Figure 6. ADC Channel 3 configuration**

![](images/adc_channel3.jpg)

The actual pins used for each channel depend on the device family selected. See Table 1 for more details.
