## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

This code example requires three analog inputs connected to the ADC. Connect a differential input to Input1 and Input2. Input3 and Input 4 are singled ended inputs.

Pin assignments for ADC inputs for supported kits are as follows:

**Table 1. ADC input signals**

Development kit | Input1 | Input2 | Input3 | Input4
-----------------|--------|--------|--------|------
CY8CKIT-149      | 2[0] | 2[1] | 1[6] | 6[0]
CY8CKIT-041-41XX | 2[0] | 2[1] | 1[5] | 0[0]
CY8CKIT-045S     | 2[2] | 2[3] | 1[5] | 6[1]
CY8CKIT-041S-MAX | 2[0] | 2[1] | 1[6] | 6[0]
CY8CPROTO-041TP  | 2[0] | 2[1] | 2[2] | 2[7]

<br>

> **Note:** The CY8CPROTO-041TP kit is equipped with an ambient light sensor connected to pin 2[7], which can sense and report light intensity in mV when connected to ADC. In dim light, the output will range from 0 mV to 10 mV, while in bright light, the reading can go up to 1199 mV (maximum), as the internal bandgap reference of 1.2 V is used as the ADC reference.

> **Note:** Some of the PSOC&trade; 4 kits ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-psoc4-sar-adc](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-sar-adc)" application with the desired name "SARADC" configured for the *CY8CKIT-041S-MAX* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-sar-adc --user-app-name SARADC --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Design and implementation


### ADC configuration

This example shows how an ADC can be configured using the Device Configurator and how different types of inputs are connected to ADC channels.

**Figure 2. Inputs connected to the ADC**

![](images/sar_adc_connection.jpg)
<br>

The ADC uses an internal bandgap reference in bypass mode as the voltage reference. Four channels are converted in each conversion cycle. A 12 MHz clock is used as the clock source.

> **Note:** The CY8CPROTO-041TP kit does not have a CTB block so that you can configure any analog pin as input 3 directly without the buffer.

**Figure 3. Basic ADC configuration**

![](images/adc_config_1.jpg)
<br>

ADC channel 0 is configured in differential mode. Input 1 and 2 act as the differential terminals for channel 0. These inputs are routed through the SAR Mux resource of the device.

**Figure 4. ADC Channel 0 configuration**

![](images/adc_channel0.jpg)
<br>

ADC channel 1 is configured in single-ended mode. Input 3 to channel 1 is buffered through CTMB0 configured in follower mode.

**Figure 5. CTBM0 configuration**

![](images/ctbm_config.jpg)
<br>

ADC channel 2 is configured in single-ended mode. Input 4 to this channel is routed through the AMUXBUS resource of the device.

**Figure 6. ADC Channel 2 configuration**

![](images/adc_channel2.jpg)
<br>

Finally, ADC channel 3 is configured in single-ended mode. This channel converts the die temperature block input. The ADC PDL provides the API to convert the count value to degree celsius.

For accurate temperature conversion, averaging (256 samples) is enabled; the acquisition time is 5 us for this channel.

**Figure 7. ADC Channel 3 configuration**

![](images/adc_channel3.jpg)
<br>

The actual pins used for each channel depend on the device family selected. See **Table 1** for more details.


### Resources and settings

In this code example, the PSOC&trade; 4 SAR ADC gets input different analog inputs and converts them to digital counts.
